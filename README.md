## Module description


This module creates an aws lambda function.

Additionally, this module also creates the following:
- A cloudwatch log group
- A security group if none is passed to the VPC enabled lambda function
- A default cloudwatch alarm

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/https://github.com/Callumccr/tf-mod-aws-lambda/releases).


The below values shown in the usage of this module are purely representative, please replace desired values as required.
